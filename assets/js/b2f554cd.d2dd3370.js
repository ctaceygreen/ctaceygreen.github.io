This would most likely act as a landing page for someone to \'get the gist\' of what these are. Low detail. Imagine the CxO of your company wants to know what these are.\\n:::\\n\\n# What is a paved path?\\nA paved path ensures that a well-trodden route is an easy, quick and safe way of reaching a clearly defined destination.\\n\\n## Hiking\\nImagine you\'re hiking through a woodland. Your destination is \'Chuck\'s Caf\xe9\', 4 miles away. You have a couple of options in this situation:\\n1. Woodland map in hand, follow the predefined path to the caf\xe9.\\n2. Knife in hand, head directly into the bush, confident you have the navigation and athletic abilities to reach the caf\xe9.\\n\\n![image of a path through woodland with two possible routes](./forest_path.png)\\n\\nClearly, #2 is a much more adventurous decision to make. It may result in you learning new skills, or honing your existing ones. It could drive you to solve problems in new, innovative ways. However, it will most likely cause you to reach the caf\xe9 much later than if you\'d followed the predefined path, dishevelled and missing your watch.\\n\\nOption #1 is our paved path. It is predictable, safe, and fast. It will need walkers to make very few decisions(maybe a fork or two), will be smooth to traverse, and protects them from the risks of the deeper woodland (see: Bears). It is also unlikely to yield any opportunities for innovation.\\n\\nThis is the equivalent of our Engineers aiming for their destination of a \'REST API\'. Nothing is stopping them from taking the untrodden path, where they will define patterns from scratch, and solve all of the problems along the way. It takes time though. It\'s also risky; there may well be challenges the team hadn\'t even considered when they started the journey, like securing their API against internal attackers. A paved path takes care of all of this for them, and much like a cookie-cutter, allows them to produce, in this example, APIs of consistent quality in a predictable amount of time.\\n\\n# Does this turn us into a stale assembly line?\\n\\nNo. But it could, if used incorrectly.\\n\\nTo succeed, we need exploitation **and** exploration. \\n\\nIf all of our teams only ever follow a fixed paved path, innovation dies. The path never evolves. The destination never changes. The technical value of the company will slowly diminish, until we wake up and realise none of our customer base owns a fax machine anymore.\\n\\nAt the other extreme, if every team is adventuring into the woodland when 80% of them are trying to reach the same destination, we\'re not exploiting enough. We\'re solving the same problems in different ways, over and over again, instead of focusing on innovating elsewhere.\\n\\nSo... we need both. We need paved paths, which serves the 80% across common use cases. We deliver consistently and with quality. The 20% are in the woodland, exploring new paths, new patterns, new technologies. These new paths may become forks on the paved path, as destinations evolve. If we ensure a balance between exploitation and exploration, paved paths massively empower our engineers and the organisation as a whole, without ever becoming stale.\\n\\nPart 3 is in development, and will explore the Whats and Whys of paved paths.\\n\\nFeatured image background by [Austin Ban](https://unsplash.com/@austinban?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/juHayWuaaoQ?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\\nMap image generated by [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/), updated using [excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw)"},{"id":"returning","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/returning","editUrl":"https://github.com/ctaceygreen/ctaceygreen.github.io/blog/2023-04-26-returning/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-26-returning/index.md","title":"Returning","description":"So I disappeared from blogging for...a year and a half.","date":"2023-04-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"returning","permalink":"/blog/tags/returning"}],"readingTime":0.73,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Chris Tacey-Green","title":"Engineer, Architect, Human","url":"https://github.com/ctaceygreen","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11404995?v=4"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"returning","title":"Returning","author":"Chris Tacey-Green","author_title":"Engineer, Architect, Human","author_url":"https://github.com/ctaceygreen","author_image_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11404995?v=4","tags":["returning"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Paved Paths Series - Part 2 - A One Pager","permalink":"/blog/paved-paths-series-part-2-a-one-pager"},"nextItem":{"title":"How do I check the health of my Azure Consumption Functions when swapping Deployment Slots?","permalink":"/blog/azure-consumption-functions-healthcheck-with-deployment-slots"}},"content":"So I disappeared from blogging for...a year and a half.\\n\\nI apologise.

Ideally, our deployment process would look something like :\\n* Deploy infrastructure\\n* Deploy code to staging slot\\n* Check downstream dependencies are correctly configured and accessible to staging slot\\n* Swap staging and production slot\\n\\nHopefully you can see now that our root URL is letting us down slightly.\\n\\nThis is where we can turn to health-checks. In many services (App Service, Kubernetes etc), zero-downtime deployments utilise health probes, which hit a predefined HTTP endpoint to determine that your app is ready and healthy. An experienced blogger and all-round smart guy named John Reilly has already created a similar post [here](https://blog.johnnyreilly.com/2021/02/11/azure-app-service-health-checks-and-zero-downtime-deployments) to explain how we can achieve this for Azure App Service. This process can be followed if you\'re running your Functions on an App Service plan. If only this worked for consumption Functions too, my post would be completely unnecessary!\\nUnfortunately, it doesn\'t. The `healthcheckPath` used in App Service to facilitate this functionality is not supported on the consumption plan. Annoying, but we still have a solution!\\n\\n## The solution\\n\\nThere are some sneaky appsettings that we can set on our Function. These configure which endpoint is used during slot warmup to check your slot is healthy. The appsettings are as follows:\\n\\n```json\\n\\"appsettings\\" : [\\n    {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH\\",\\n        \\"value\\": \\"[parameters(\'healthcheckPath\')]\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH\\",\\n        \\"value\\": \\"[parameters(\'healthcheckPath\')]\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES\\",\\n        \\"value\\": \\"200\\"\\n    }\\n    ...\\n]\\n```\\n\\n* `WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH` - Used in a few different areas of Azure. The reason we need it is because we have authentication enabled across all endpoints of our Function. Unlike the healthcheckPath functionality of app-service, the Function slot warmup process does not run \'behind\' the auth/ip restriction layer. Therefore, this appsetting specifies that the authentication layer should ignore this path and allow anonymous calls. This should be considered carefully with your use-case, ensuring that you\'re not opening yourself up to DOS attacks or returning sensitive information that can be used as a security hole.\\n* `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH` - The path to your healthcheck/ping endpoint on your Function. e.g. \'/api/healthcheck\'\\n* `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES` - The statuses that you will accept as a successful response from your healthcheck endpoint. Without this, Azure will consider some redirect status codes as successful responses, so in our example we\'re making this much more specific with just a \'200\' considered successful.\\n\\nAfter adding this into your ARM template for the Function `Microsoft.Web/Sites` and it\'s associated slot, you\'re good to go! The final step is to ensure that your ADO pipeline is running the task below to swap slots on your Function:\\n\\n```yml\\n- task: AzureAppServiceManager@0\\n  displayName: \'Swap Staging Slot with Production\'\\n  inputs:\\n    action: \'Swap Slots\'\\n    azureSubscription: \'$(azureSubscription)\'\\n    resourceGroupName: $(resourceGroupName)\\n    webAppName: $(functionName)\\n    SourceSlot: \'stage\'\\n```\\n\\nRunning this ADO pipeline step will now check your `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH` is returning the expected status before swapping your slot into production. This should greatly reduce the likelihood of a consumption Function being deployed to production with misconfigured dependencies (e.g. invalid connection-string). You could easily implement this pattern for any consumption Functions within your estate, even non-http-triggers, all you\'d need to do is ensure that an associated healthcheck http-trigger Function was deployed alongside it.\\n\\nThat should do us for this one! If anything isn\'t clear, get in touch and I\'d be happy to provide more reproducable examples of the entire ARM template and pipeline steps.\\n\\nUntil next time..."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/ctaceygreen/ctaceygreen.github.io/blog/2021-08-1-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-1-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"I figured the first post couldn\'t be a heavy technical braindump.
